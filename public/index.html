				<p>
					JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
					is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
					example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
					its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
				<p>
					JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
					Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
					control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
					for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
					for example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
						For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
						elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
						clicks, form input, and page navigation.
          </li>
          <br>
					<li>
						Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
						server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
						database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
						another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
						server.
          </li>
          </ul></br>
